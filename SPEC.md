# SPEC - markkennethbadilla.com

## What this is

Mark Kenneth Badilla's personal site. It is a portfolio, and its centrepiece is a
live demonstration of the thing he claims to do: constrain an LLM agent with
deterministic gates so it physically cannot ship a dangerous change.

## Features

- **Resume surface** - hero, about, work history, education, skills, projects,
  contact. All content lives in one file, `src/data/resume.tsx`.
- **The agent harness** (`/#harness`) - a visitor asks an agent for something
  dangerous. A live model writes the change; deterministic gates run on its
  output in the browser; a blocked gate feeds its reason back and the model
  rewrites, up to three rounds.
- **Live telemetry** - per attempt: latency, input/output/total tokens, cost,
  position in the fallback chain, finish reason, and whether the output schema
  was enforced. The provider chain in use is shown before anything is run.

## Routes

| Route | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | static | The whole site. Single page. |
| `/api/agent` | Worker | POST. Runs one agent attempt. |
| `/api/models` | Worker | GET. Reports the discovered free-model chain and limiter status. |

## Locked decisions

1. **Forked `magicuidesign/portfolio` (MIT), not hand-built.** A hand-rolled
   portfolio looks hand-rolled; the previous iteration of this site proved it.
2. **Rejected `once-ui-system/magic-portfolio` despite it looking better.** It is
   CC BY-NC 4.0 - non-commercial with mandatory attribution, which is the wrong
   licence for a site whose purpose is winning paid work.
3. **Static export, not the OpenNext Workers adapter.** OpenNext cannot build from
   a non-`C:` drive on Windows (Node's ESM loader rejects an `a:` URL scheme), and
   every route here prerenders anyway. A Worker handles only `/api/*`.
4. **Free models are discovered at runtime, never hardcoded.** OpenRouter's free
   tier churns; pinned slugs guarantee a dead demo within weeks. Only the final
   fallback (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`) is fixed.
5. **Filter free models on modality exclusively, not inclusively.** Google's Lyria
   advertises `output_modalities: ["text","audio"]`, so `includes("text")` accepts
   a music model. A usable chat model emits text and nothing else.
6. **`generateText` + explicit Zod parse, not `generateObject`.** Every model in
   the cascade failed provider-side structured output, including a paid one. The
   Zod contract still rejects non-conforming output; it is simply enforced by us.
   A schema no model can satisfy is not a guardrail, it is an outage.
7. **Gates run client-side and are readable.** `src/lib/gates.ts` ships to the
   browser on purpose - a visitor can read exactly what blocked them.
8. **Degradation is announced, never faked.** With no key, past the rate limit, or
   with every model down, the panel says so and shows a labelled fixed example.

## Non-goals

- **No chatbot.** The model is an actor inside a pipeline, not a conversation
  partner. A chat box would be generic and would demonstrate nothing.
- **No self-scored capability charts.** Arbitrary self-assessment destroys
  credibility with the exact audience this site targets.
- **No "available for hire" banner.** The site reads as a senior engineer's work,
  not as an appeal.
- **No blog until there is real writing.** An empty blog reads worse than none.
- **No paid infrastructure.** Cloudflare free tier, free-tier inference, hard
  daily cap.

## Guardrails on the demo

- Burst rate limiting via the Cloudflare native rate-limit binding, at the edge.
- A global daily request ceiling in KV, independent of the burst limiter.
- Input validated by Zod with a hard length cap before any model is called.
- Output validated by Zod; non-conforming responses advance the cascade.
